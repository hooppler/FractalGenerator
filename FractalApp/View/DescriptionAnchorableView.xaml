    <TextBox Text="In mathematics, a fractal is a subset of Euclidean space with a fractal dimension that strictly exceeds its topological dimension. 
                       Fractals appear the same at different scales,
                       as illustrated in successive magnifications of the Mandelbrot set. 
                       Fractals often exhibit similar patterns at increasingly smaller scales, 
                       a property called self-similarity, also known as expanding symmetry or unfolding symmetry; 
                       if this replication is exactly the same at every scale, 
                       as in the Menger sponge, it is called affine self-similar. 
                       Fractal geometry lies within the mathematical branch of measure theory." TextAlignment="Left" TextWrapping="Wrap" HorizontalAlignment="Stretch" VerticalScrollBarVisibility="Auto"/>
